Note: The user guide is the in application help system. The files are machine read so changes to content needs to following guidelines:

-  [src root]/server/openstorefront/openstorefront-web/src/main/resources/userhelp.md
-  Sections are read from header to header
-  The header level determines the nesting level.  (Eg. h1, h2..etc)
-  Image locations are adjusted they should follow what is currently in the document
-  Set the security permission required on the header @ADMIN-SYSTEM-MANAGEMENT
