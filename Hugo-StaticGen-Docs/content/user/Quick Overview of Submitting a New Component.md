To get to the User Tools section, click on your user name in the upper right corner of the page and then select User Tools from the drop down menu. Once at the User Tools sections, click on the Submissions button and then click the New Submission button.

The first page of the Submission Form asks you to verify your own information. Any changes here will directly update your profile information.

The second page is for information about the entry you are submitting to Storefront. Available Entry Types will be controlled by your administrator. Pick the one that best applies to your submission. Each Entry Type can have different required Attributes that must be filled in before continuing. All fields with a red star must be filled in before continuing. In the Description section please include information on what the submission is and why it should be evaluated or of interest to the community. This information is what the community will see first when the search for this entry.
